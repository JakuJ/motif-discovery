### Overview

FASCIA is an open-source software package for determining approximate counts of tree-structured subgraphs 
in large networks. It is a parallel implementation based on the
[color-coding](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=210337) method. Relative frequency information of various subgraphs
serves as a very useful graph signature, and this information can be used for other graph analytics such as
network alignment and clustering.

### Features

* Extremely fast and memory-efficient implementation.
* Multicore parallelism (using OpenMP) and support for distributed-memory systems (MPI).
* C++, mostly header-only implementation, no external dependencies, very easy to compile.
* Wide range of graph analytics supported (see Usage Examples section below).

### Installation

Download the source code for the latest version of FASCIA ([version 1.0](http://sourceforge.net/projects/fascia-psu/files/)) from SourceForge.

Alternately, get the latest source code from the git repository:

`git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/fascia-psu/code fascia-psu-code`

Type make in the main directory to build the executable fascia. There is just one .cpp file to compile, and the
rest of the code is header-only. 

We have tested version 1.0 of FASCIA on Linux with the GNU C++ compiler (versions 4.8.2 and 4.4.7)
and Intel C++ compiler (version 13.0.1), as well as on Windows 8 64-bit with Cygwin and GNU
C++ compiler (version 4.8.2).  

### Usage Examples

* List all the supported functions.

   `./fascia -h`

* Given a template and a larger graph, determine the approximate count of the template in the 
larger graph.

   `./fascia -g test_small.graph -t template.graph`
   
* Vary the number of iterations. The default is to perform just one color-coding iteration. 

   `./fascia -g test_small.graph -t template.graph -i 100`

* Print execution time information, perform an outer loop parallelization. 

   `./fascia -g hpylo.graph -t template.graph -i 100 -o -r`

* Run FASCIA in batch mode. Get counts for several different templates (in this example, all tree templates of size 8).
  
   `./fascia -g hpylo.graph -b motif/graphs_n8_23/batchfile`
   
* Compute approximate counts of all tree-structured templates of a certain size (size 8 in the example below, 23 of them).  

   `./fascia -g hpylo.graph -m 8`

* Output per-vertex template counts.  
   
   `./fascia -g hpylo.graph -t template.graph -c`

* Generate graphlet/treelet degree distribution.  

   `./fascia -g hpylo.graph -t template.graph -d`

* Plot graphlet/treelet degree distribution: see the R script plot_gdd.r.   
   
### Current Release Notes

1. The first release is a simplified version of the shared-memory parallel algorithm presented in the ICPP 2013 paper. The code with MPI support is coming up shortly, and is available upon request.
2. The current release only supports undirected graphs.
3. Please see the files test_small.graph and template.graph for examples of the graph input format. Currently, an edge list text format is supported.
